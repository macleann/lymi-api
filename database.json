This approach would normally result in a tedious album if not for two things: the outrageous specificity of Brian's lyrics, and his impish urge to juxtapose unfussy, tear-in-your-beer balladry with decidedly un-country influences. The result is an album that encompasses anger, joy, disgust, bagpipes, ring modulation and balkan bichronality, all with a coherent character at the center, engaging in good faith with the phoniness of country like all the other loveable losers and no account boozers before him.",

      "name": "Crumbsnatchers",
      "bio": "Hailing from Nashville, Crumbsnatchers’ catchy songs echo the wit of Pixies and Talking Heads, backed by the fervent force of Beastie Boys. Their contagiously immersive music has a habit of crushing your inhibitions into a fine paste and then painting the word “PARTY” on your brain with it.\n\nFrontman Samuel “Guetts” Guetterman pulled the band name from an experience in 2007, when, at 16 years old, he was sentenced to a year in a faith-based juvenile detention camp, in Griffin, Georgia. While enduring widespread physical abuse and abhorrent, moldy, living conditions (due to non-existent judicial oversight), Guetterman and the other boys sang in a touring church choir as examples of “reformed” rebellious teens. “Crumbsnatchers” was a condescending nickname the staff gave the boys when they sang. Secular music was contraband in the program, but a few months in, a fellow student smuggled in a CD player and a copy of Radiohead’s In Rainbows, which the boys listened to while hiding under their beds.\n\nCrumbsnatchers began in Knoxville, Tennessee when Guetterman joined his songwriting prowess with guitarist Philip Mosteller, bassist Sam Burchfield, and drummer Rylan Bledsoe. Tragically, Rylan Bledsoe passed away on the 6th of July, 2020. He is dearly missed by everyone who knew him. Rylan’s influence is recorded in the drums of Crumbsnatchers’ debut album Big House.\n\n“Satin Glow” and “One Call” are the first singles off an EP to be released in 2022 via Nashville label Like You Mean It Records. Crumbsnatchers is: Guetts Guetterman (rhythm guitar, vocals), Philip Mosteller (lead guitar), Ethan Mausolf (drums), and a few other amazing musicians who lend their talents. ",
